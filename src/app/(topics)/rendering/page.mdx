# Rendering Strategy

Before the arrival of Next 13, we had several options for rendering pages:

- **SSR** (Server Side Rendering)
- **SSG** (Static Site Generation)
- **ISR** (Incremental Static Regeneration)

After the introduction of the App router, we gained another, entirely new type of page rendering:

- **Server components** (hybrid web applications)

To avoid dragging on and diving into what everyone already knows, let's quickly gather the drawbacks of Next < 12 rendering,
and then see how all these issues are addressed in Next >= 13.

### Drawbacks of SSR, SSG, ISR

- It's impossible to combine SSR & ISR. If we want dynamic SEO data, we need to use SSR,
  but in this case, we lose page loading speed and all the benefits of ISR.
- Limited capabilities in working with the root `<html>` tag.
- All SEO features must be configured manually, often involving third-party libraries.

### App router & Server components

- Allows the use of SSR & ISR together. This is literally implied by the name - **hybrid web applications**.
- Enables flexible handling of any page elements, conveniently reusing them.
- Most SEO features are already integrated into Next.js, with only configuration required.

## Conclusion

App router and server components is a huge step forward in the development of web applications both Technial and SEO.
It's a new level of flexibility and convenience. Use it and enjoy it!
