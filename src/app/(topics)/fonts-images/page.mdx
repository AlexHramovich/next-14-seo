# Images, fonts and scripts optimizations

In this topic we're not going to separate pages and app routers,
because we're going to talk about some optimizations that can be applied to both.

All we need to do is to make sure we use components that Next.js provides us.
BTW, those components were developed by the Next.js team in collaboration with Google, so these elements aware of the best practices.

## Images

By using Next.js image component we are able to cover several optimizations:

- faster page loads (LCP)
- size optimization (LCP)
- avoid layout shift (CLS)
- asset flexibility (LCP)

Here is an example of how to use it:

```jsx
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  );
}
```

Here is the link to official documentation where you can find more full API.

</a>

## Fonts

`next/font` provides us with a component that allows us to load fonts in a way that is optimized for performance.
It's exceptionally useful for loading fonts from Google Fonts, but it can also be used to load fonts from other sources.
It has built-in automatic self-hoisting, so CLS is not a problem with that solution.

#### Google fonts

```jsx
import { Roboto } from "next/font/google";

const roboto = Roboto({
  weight: "400",
  subsets: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
});

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={roboto.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

#### Local fonts

```jsx
import localFont from "next/font/local";

// Font files can be colocated inside of `app`
const myFont = localFont({
  src: "./my-font.woff2",
  display: "swap",
});

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={myFont.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Scripts

Same sort of optimizatoions is also avaible for scripts.
The most important part of this component is `strategy` that can be a gamechanger for your app.
Find more about it in the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/script" target="\_blank">DOCS</a>.

Example:

```jsx
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <>
      <section>{children}</section>
      <Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="afterInteractive" />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

All these components are really your best friends when it comes to performance optimization.
Amazing job from the Next.js team! Make sure you use them in your app everywhere you can.
