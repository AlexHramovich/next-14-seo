# Scructured data

Structured data is crucial for enabling search engines to understand your web pages more effectively.
Over time, various vocabularies have been constantly changing, but currently, the most actual one is schema.org.

Schema.org is described on its website as a "collaborative, community activity aimed at developing,
maintaining, and advocating for schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and more."

The vocabulary provided by Schema.org is compatible with several encodings, such as RDFa, Microdata, and JSON-LD.

Different search engines may utilize various vocabularies from schema.org,
and it's important to note that no single search engine incorporates all the use cases outlined in schema.org's vocabulary.
It's advisable to verify which vocabularies are recognized by each search engine.

This looks something like this, I'm sure. You must have seen such results in searches before.

## Pages router

When using a classic router, you will have to manually add structured data to each page.
That means the approach remains unchanged; we need to find a way to bring modern practices into our Next project.

Below we present an official example from the Next.js documentation.
This is an example of what a product page might look like.

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";

function ProductPage() {
  function addProductJsonLd() {
    return {
      __html: `{
      "@context": "https://schema.org/",
      "@type": "Product",
      "name": "Executive Anvil",
      "image": [
        "https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg",
        "https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg",
        "https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg"
       ],
      "description": "Sleeker than ACME's Classic Anvil, the Executive Anvil is perfect for the business traveler looking for something to drop from a height.",
      "sku": "0446310786",
      "mpn": "925872",
      "brand": {
        "@type": "Brand",
        "name": "ACME"
      },
      "review": {
        "@type": "Review",
        "reviewRating": {
          "@type": "Rating",
          "ratingValue": "4",
          "bestRating": "5"
        },
        "author": {
          "@type": "Person",
          "name": "Fred Benson"
        }
      },
      "aggregateRating": {
        "@type": "AggregateRating",
        "ratingValue": "4.4",
        "reviewCount": "89"
      },
      "offers": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "url": "https://example.com/anvil",
        "priceCurrency": "USD",
        "price": "119.99",
        "priceValidUntil": "2020-11-20",
        "itemCondition": "https://schema.org/UsedCondition",
        "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
      }
    }
  `,
    };
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My Product</title>
        <meta
          name="description"
          content="Super product with free shipping."
          key="desc"
        />
        <script
          type="application/ld+json"
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={addProductJsonLd()}
          key="product-jsonld"
        />
      </Head>
      <h1>My Product</h1>
      <p>Super product for sale.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProductPage;
```

Overall, this is a decent option, but you need a clear understanding of how it works and what data needs to be added.

## App router

We would like to say that the App router brings a ready-made solution, but that's not the case.
We will have to follow the same path, namely, to add structured data to a script tag that will be inserted into the page.

Let's consider it using the example of a product page, but with less data,
as the concept is exactly the same as in the previous example.

```jsx
export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const product = await getProduct(params.id);

  const jsonLd = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    name: product.name,
    image: product.image,
    description: product.description,
  };

  return (
    <section>
      {/* Add JSON-LD to your page */}
      <script
        type="application/ld+json"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}
      />
      {/* ... */}
    </section>
  );
}
```

What can really make life easier is a type library, recommended for everyone. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-dts" target="_blank">LINK</a>.
It's much easier to create these objects with its help.

```jsx
import { Product, WithContext } from "schema-dts";

const jsonLd: WithContext<Product> = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  name: "Next.js Sticker",
  image: "https://nextjs.org/imgs/sticker.png",
  description: "Dynamic at the speed of static.",
};
```

Alas, there are no magical ways to make everything easy,
but this is still one of the important and crucial methods to progress in SEO.
