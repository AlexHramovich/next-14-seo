# Canonical & Localization tags

When working with a website that has multiple versions of pages, such as localization,
we need to know how to correctly indicate which page to navigate to if we are on a non-canonical page.
And the right way to do it is to use the canonical and alternate tags.

## Pages router

in this section we will cover 2 topics:

- **canonical tag**
- **alternates tags**

Both topics are equally important for SEO, but be sure you understand them well, they can potentially damage your SEO if you use them wrong.

The is no difference what meta tags you would to add to the page the method is the same.
Use `<Head>` component from `next/head` package and add meta tags inside it.

This way we need to create a banch of tags based on the data we have.
Would be a good idea to carefully follow an official Google documentation, because here we have some tricky moments. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls" target="_blank">
Canonical docs</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions" target="_blank">Alternates docs</a>

```js
import Head from "next/head";

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
        <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/" />
        <link
          rel="alternate"
          hrefLang="en-gb"
          href="https://en-gb.example.com/page.html"
        />
        <link
          rel="alternate"
          hrefLang="en-us"
          href="https://en-us.example.com/page.html"
        />
        <link
          rel="alternate"
          hrefLang="en"
          href="https://en.example.com/page.html"
        />
        <link
          rel="alternate"
          hrefLang="de"
          href="https://de.example.com/page.html"
        />
        <link
          rel="alternate"
          hrefLang="x-default"
          href="https://www.example.com/"
        />
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default IndexPage;
```

## App router

To cover the same topics in the app router we just need to extend the Metadata object with the new properties.
Please learn more about this object in the <a href="/topics/metadata">Metadata</a> section.

```js
export const metadata = {
  alternates: {
    canonical: "https://nextjs.org",
    languages: {
      "en-US": "https://nextjs.org/en-US",
      "de-DE": "https://nextjs.org/de-DE",
    },
    media: {
      "only screen and (max-width: 600px)": "https://nextjs.org/mobile",
    },
    types: {
      "application/rss+xml": "https://nextjs.org/rss",
    },
  },
};
```

This code will result in the following tags:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://nextjs.org" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-US" href="https://nextjs.org/en-US" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de-DE" href="https://nextjs.org/de-DE" />
<link
  rel="alternate"
  media="only screen and (max-width: 600px)"
  href="https://nextjs.org/mobile"
/>
<link
  rel="alternate"
  type="application/rss+xml"
  href="https://nextjs.org/rss"
/>
```

Same rools are applied. You need to learn more about the Alternates and Canonical tags and use them wisely.

## Conclusion

There is no huge difference between the app and pages router.
It's only about syntax and the way you use it. but we like App router version more, because it's more documented and easy to read.
