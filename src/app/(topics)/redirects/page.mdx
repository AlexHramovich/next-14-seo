# Redirects

In Next.js, there are many ways to implement redirects.
We will list them, but we won't go into details, as it would take a lot of time.
However, we will discuss where and which method can be applicable.

### Next.js execution order

Take a look at the list below, it shows the order in which code is executed during a page request.
Based on this, you can decide which redirect method suits you best, as the speed of its execution will obviously vary.

1. **headers** from next.config.js
2. **redirects** from next.config.js
3. **Middleware** (rewrites, redirects, etc.)
4. **beforeFiles** (rewrites) from next.config.js
5. **Filesystem routes** (public/, \_next/static/, pages/, app/, etc.)
6. **afterFiles** (rewrites) from next.config.js
7. **Dynamic Routes** (/blog/[slug])
8. **fallback** (rewrites) from next.config.js

### Next.js config

Regardless of the router, you can manage redirects at the project configuration level.
This method is the fastest because it's executed before Next.js starts processing requests.
It's excellent for static redirects that don't require dynamic management.

```jsx
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/old-blog/:slug",
        destination: "/news/:slug", // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
        permanent: true,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

It's important to note that this is a quite flexible approach,
as these redirects can be managed based on headers or query parameters.

```jsx
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      // if the header `x-redirect-me` is present,
      // this redirect will be applied
      {
        source: "/:path((?!another-page$).*)",
        has: [
          {
            type: "header",
            key: "x-redirect-me",
          },
        ],
        permanent: false,
        destination: "/another-page",
      },
      // if the header `x-dont-redirect` is present,
      // this redirect will NOT be applied
      {
        source: "/:path((?!another-page$).*)",
        missing: [
          {
            type: "header",
            key: "x-do-not-redirect",
          },
        ],
        permanent: false,
        destination: "/another-page",
      },
      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,
      // this redirect will be applied
      {
        source: "/specific/:path*",
        has: [
          {
            type: "query",
            key: "page",
            // the page value will not be available in the
            // destination since value is provided and doesn't
            // use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)
            value: "home",
          },
          {
            type: "cookie",
            key: "authorized",
            value: "true",
          },
        ],
        permanent: false,
        destination: "/another/:path*",
      },
      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and
      // contains a matching value, this redirect will be applied
      {
        source: "/",
        has: [
          {
            type: "header",
            key: "x-authorized",
            value: "(?<authorized>yes|true)",
          },
        ],
        permanent: false,
        destination: "/home?authorized=:authorized",
      },
      // if the host is `example.com`,
      // this redirect will be applied
      {
        source: "/:path((?!another-page$).*)",
        has: [
          {
            type: "host",
            value: "example.com",
          },
        ],
        permanent: false,
        destination: "/another-page",
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

These redirects also support basePath and locale, making them convenient for use in various applications.

## Pages router

Now, let's move on to routers and the differences between them.
In the Pages router, we have access to several additional methods of redirects.

### getStaticProps

At the stage of page generation or revalidation,
you can define how the page should behave. This way, you can set up a redirect for it.

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://...`);
  const data = await res.json();

  if (!data) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: "/",
        permanent: false,
        // statusCode: 301
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props
  };
}
```

### getServerSideProps

Another way to achieve the same goal is by using a dynamic method,
which allows for dynamic redirects at the user request level.

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`);
  const data = await res.json();

  if (!data) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: "/",
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  };
}
```

## App router

In the new version of our router, we also have the capability to perform redirects in a unique way.
Moreover, it looks very simple and straightforward.

The **redirect** function allows you to redirect the user to another URL.
**redirect** can be used in Server Components, Client Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.

```jsx
redirect(path, type);
```

YES! As simple as that.

```jsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

async function fetchTeam(id) {
  const res = await fetch("https://...");
  if (!res.ok) return undefined;
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Profile({ params }) {
  const team = await fetchTeam(params.id);
  if (!team) {
    redirect("/login");
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Summary

Nothing ever disappears from the internet without a trace.
When you delete pages, change their paths, or migrate an old website to a new domain,
it's crucial to ensure that users don't encounter 404 errors.
Instead, they should be seamlessly redirected to the new pages.
Otherwise, Google may consider the pages deleted and start removing them from its index, resulting in a loss of traffic.

There are numerous ways to implement redirects,
but it's important to understand that each method has its unique features and is suitable for different scenarios.

Good luck with your redirects implementation!
